    In my current role, I design and maintain CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure using Terraform, Terragrunt, and Helm to support microservices deployed on Kubernetes (EKS and OpenShift), following GitOps practices across multiple environments.

    I've managed certificate lifecycle for service endpoints and worked with application proxies such as NGINX, HAProxy, OpenShift Routes, and Squid, along with CDNs fronting public-facing applications.

    Security scanning for source code, container images, and OSS dependencies was integrated into pipelines, running automatically on new code commits.

    Iâ€™ve contributed to PCI-DSS compliance efforts and supported performance testing to ensure system reliability under load.

    My responsibilities also included supporting PCI-DSS compliant services, where I participated in assessments, implemented remediations, and enforced infrastructure-level security controls. I operate within a SAFe Agile environment, working closely with developers, testers, and security engineers to deliver scalable, secure, and observable systems.
